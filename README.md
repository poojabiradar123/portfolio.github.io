### Hello, I'm Pooja Biradar 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### Smart Networking System

A Smart Networking System leverages advanced technologies like Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Edge Computing to create efficient, scalable, and adaptive networks. SDN centralizes network control by decoupling the control and data planes, allowing dynamic management and configuration. NFV virtualizes traditional hardware-based network functions, reducing costs and increasing flexibility. AI and Machine Learning (ML) play a pivotal role in predictive analytics, traffic optimization, anomaly detection, and adaptive routing. Integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) ensures seamless management of connected devices, providing secure, low-latency communication. Edge computing further enhances performance by processing data closer to the source, reducing the load on centralized servers. Together, these technologies create intelligent, automated systems capable of meeting the demands of modern connectivity, ensuring high efficiency, security, and user satisfaction.

Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:  

Smart networking systems revolutionize connectivity by enhancing efficiency, scalability, and security in modern networks. They reduce operational costs through automation and virtualization, enabling real-time traffic management and predictive maintenance. By integrating AI and IoT, these systems optimize resource allocation, improve user experiences, and support large-scale device ecosystems. Edge computing minimizes latency, ensuring faster data processing and better performance. Additionally, smart networks bolster cybersecurity with advanced anomaly detection and adaptive threat responses. Overall, they empower industries with reliable, future-ready infrastructure, driving innovation, seamless communication, and digital transformation across various sectors.
